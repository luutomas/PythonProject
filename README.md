# Proposition 1
Scrape the properties of flat in the Czech Republic (can be focused on Prague only) via various sites such as bezrealitky.cz, remax.cz, ulovdomov.cz and create two seperate databases, one is flat for sale and the second one is the flat for renting. Thus obtaining two cross-section database.
The idea is to assign to each flat for sale a renting value, which it can generate. This help to determine whether the flat has a good investment value.
# Proposition 2
Scrape all places of the Atlas Obscura (https://www.atlasobscura.com/) with their attributes (short bio, popularity, hashtags). Such data collection would enable us to study trends of these extraordinary sights, perform text analysis and work with data in more creative way than the original website does.
For a deeper research,  certain geographical subset (e.g. Europe or U.S.) could be used together with other tourism data.
